Hey! I'm Raveen. 

A little about me:
- I did my undergrad and currently doing my masters in mechanical engineering
- I am a licensed glider pilot and glider instructor with the air cadet program
- If you are interested in the [stuff I use]({{< relref "stuff.md" >}})
- If you wanna see what's on my [bucket list]({{< relref "bucketlist.md" >}})

My hobbies include:
    - Reading 
    - Playing Pokemon Go - I've really gotten into it in the past year and a half
    - Retro Tech - I find technology from the 60s to 90s so fascinating 
    - Starting projects (hardly ever finishing them) - I love the research and ideation phase but putting them into action is the hard part

    - shows: Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Frieren, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Bojack Horseman, Mad Men
