      <description>&lt;p&gt;5 Friend and I hiked through 40ish km of the Western Uplands hike in August of 2024! This was my first time planning a hiking trip and I wanted to document my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;route&#34;&gt;Route&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insert image of route&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;We stayed at the following campsites:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Islet 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tern 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ishkuday 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the route was good! Most of the campsites were fine, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend Ishkuday 1. The other campsites had easy water access but at Ishkuday, it was past a bog. There were some planks to stand on but its not very secure and I fell in! Eventually, I just stripped and then made many trips in and out of the bog. As funny as a story as it was, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay at that one again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
