<p>5 Friend and I hiked through 40ish km of the Western Uplands hike in August of 2024! This was my first time planning a hiking trip and I wanted to document my experience.</p>
<h1 id="route">Route</h1>
<figure class="ma0 w-75"><img src="/images/western-uplands-post/map.png"
    alt="Map of western uplands route with colours for each leg" width="50%"><figcaption>
      <p>This was the route we followed. Each colour is a different day</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We stayed at the following campsites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islet 2</li>
<li>Tern 2</li>
<li>Ishkuday 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the route was good! Most of the campsites were fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Ishkuday 1. The other campsites had easy water access but at Ishkuday, it was past a bog. There were some planks to stand on but its not very secure and I fell in! Eventually, I just stripped and then made many trips in and out of the bog. As funny as a story as it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t stay at that one again.</p>
<h2 id="mileage">Mileage</h2>
<p>Here is how our mileage looked over the trip. The time includes lunch and snack breaks, so though we probably walked quicker, stops needed to be factored in.</p>

<p>I like this route! Since we had a few new backpackers on the trip, I didn&rsquo;t want to overdo it with the daily mileage so we were able to hike for 3-4 hour with plenty of breaks in between and still make it to camp well before sunset. This hike has an additional 30 kilometers so I definitely want to try the full 70 at some point.</p>

<p>I liked the gear I brought, I felt like I used everything I had, or it was good to have in case (ie. the first aid kit).</p>

<p>This is basically my staples for camping trips. I don&rsquo;t have a dehydrater nor do I like buying those freeze dried meals so these are my budget camping options! I think future trips will have a similar plan.</p>

<p>We got to the parking lot around <em>insert time</em>. We decided to eat our lunches early, so after eating and using the bathroom we were off! Nothing unsual or just standard (and awesome) Algonquin park.</p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>Day 2 was good. Algonquin is mostly flat with one or two steep hills. Not a problem if you take it slow. Got to campsite 2 without a hitch.</p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>Day 3 was interesting! A lot mixed terrain from forests to lakes and marshes. We had to travese some deep mud spots using some makeshift bridges that were laid out for us. Like I mentioned above, this campsite (Ishkuday 1) was large, but water access wasn&rsquo;t optimal. You can even see my clothes hanging on the tree after I fell in to the bog in one of the pictures.</p>

<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>
<p>Final day! This was basically the reverse of day 1 so a lot of familiar sights! Since everyone was excited to make it back to the cars, the motivation was high to move quickly.</p>
