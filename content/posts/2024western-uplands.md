5 Friend and I hiked through 40ish km of the Western Uplands hike in August of 2024! This was my first time planning a hiking trip and I wanted to document my experience.
# Route
**insert image of route**
We stayed at the following campsites:
- Islet 2
- Tern 2
- Ishkuday 1 

Overall, the route was good! Most of the campsites were fine, but I wouldn't recommend Ishkuday 1. The other campsites had easy water access but at Ishkuday, it was past a bog. There were some planks to stand on but its not very secure and I fell in! Eventually, I just stripped and then made many trips in and out of the bog. As funny as a story as it was, I wouldn't stay at that one again. 
## Mileage
Here is how our mileage looked over the trip. The time includes lunch and snack breaks, so though we probably walked quicker, stops needed to be factored in.

| Day | Leg                        | Distance (Km) | Total Time (Hrs) | Speed (Km/Hr) |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Rain Lake (start) - Islet  | 11.7          | 4.5              | 2.6           |
| 2   | Islet - Tern               | 12.9          | 5.41             | 2.38          |
| 3   | Tern - Ishkuday            | 13            | 6                | 2.17          |
| 4   | Ishkuday - Rain Lake (end) | 11.7          | 4.3              | 2.72          |
| -   | Total                      | 49.3          |                  |               |

I like this route! Since we had a few new backpackers on the trip, I didn't want to overdo it with the daily mileage so we were able to hike for 3-4 hour with plenty of breaks in between and still make it to camp well before sunset. This hike has an additional 30 kilometers so I definitely want to try the full 70 at some point.

I liked the gear I brought, I felt like I used everything I had, or it was good to have in case (ie. the first aid kit).

This is basically my staples for camping trips. I don't have a dehydrater nor do I like buying those freeze dried meals so these are my budget camping options! I think future trips will have a similar plan.

## Day 1

We got to the parking lot around *insert time*. We decided to eat our lunches early, so after eating and using the bathroom we were off! Nothing unsual or just standard (and awesome) Algonquin park.

## Day 2
Day 2 was good. Algonquin is mostly flat with one or two steep hills. Not a problem if you take it slow. Got to campsite 2 without a hitch.

## Day 3

Day 3 was interesting! A lot mixed terrain from forests to lakes and marshes. We would have to travese some deep mud spots using some makeshift bridges that were laid out for us. Like I mentioned above, though this campsite was large, water access wasn't optimal. You can even see my clothes hanging on the tree after I fell in to the bog.

## Day 4
Final day! This was basically the reverse of day 1 so a lot of familiar sights! Since everyone was excited to make it back to the cars, the motivation was high to move quickly.
