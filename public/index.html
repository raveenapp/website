<p>5 Friend and I hiked through 40ish km of the Western Uplands hike in August of 2024! This was my first time planning a hiking trip and I wanted to document my experience.</p>
<h1 id="route">Route</h1>
<figure class="ma0 w-75"><img src="/images/western-uplands-post/map.png"
    alt="Map of western uplands route with colours for each leg" width="50%"><figcaption>
      <p>This was the route we followed. Each colour is a different day</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We stayed at the following campsites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islet 2</li>
<li>Tern 2</li>
<li>Ishkuday 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the route was good! Most of the campsites were fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Ishkuday 1. The other campsites had easy water access but at Ishkuday, it was past a bog. There were some planks to stand on but its not very secure and I fell in! Eventually, I just stripped and then made many trips in and out of the bog. As funny as a story as it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t stay at that one again.</p>
